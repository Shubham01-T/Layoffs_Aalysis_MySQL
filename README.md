# Layoffs_Aalysis_MySQL

In this project I worked on 'Layoffs Data'. Which consists layoff statistics from different companies around the globe. The data consists columns like Company name, location, total laid off, percentage laid off, stage, funds raised etc. 
I started off by cleaning the data in MySQL workbench followed by Exploratory data analysis of the cleaned data and finally Visualizing the data.
